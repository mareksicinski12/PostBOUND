# This script shows how to implement a custom join ordering algorithm by implementing a simple randomized "optimizer"
# The algorithm only produces linear join paths for queries without cross products.
#
# Requirements: a running IMDB instance on Postgres with the connect file being set-up correctly. This can be achieved using
# the utilities in the root postgres directory.
