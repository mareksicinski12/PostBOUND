# drop-caches

`drop-caches` is a simple utility to flush the UNIX page cache without superuser privileges.
The program is adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/a/13647032

To generate the executable, just run `make`.

To invoke the utility, run it from the `util/bin` directory (a symlink will be automatically created when invoking
`make`), or run it from this directory.
