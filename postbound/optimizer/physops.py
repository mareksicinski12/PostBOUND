    - for nested-loop joins the outer relation corresponds to the outer loop and the inner relation is the inner loop. As a

class PhysicalOperatorAssignment:
    """The physical operator assignment stores the operators that should be used for specific joins or scans.

    The assignment can happen at different levels:

    - `global_settings` enable or disable specific operators for the entire query
    - `join_operators` and `scan_operators` are concerned with specific (joins of) base tables. These assignments overwrite the
      global settings, i.e. it is possible to assign a nested loop join to a specific set of tables, but disable NLJ globally.
      In this case, only the specified join will be executed as an NLJ and other algorithms are used for all other joins

    The basic assumption here is that for all joins and scans that have no assignment, the database system should determine the
    best operators by itself.

    Although it is allowed to modify the different dictionaries directly, the more high-level methods should be used instead.
    This ensures that all potential (future) invariants are maintained.

    The assignment enables ``__getitem__`` access and tries to determine the requested setting in an intelligent way, i.e.
    supplying a single base table will provide the associated scan operator, supplying an iterable of base tables the join
    operator and supplying an operator will return the global setting. If no item is found, ``None`` will be returned.

    ----------
