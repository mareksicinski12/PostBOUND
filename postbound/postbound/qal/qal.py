"""*qal* describes the query abstraction layer of PostBOUND. It offers interfaces to operate with SQL queries on a high level.

The most important type of our query abstraction is the `SqlQuery` class, which is defined in this module. It focuses on
modelling an entire SQL query with all important concepts. Notice that the focus here really in on modelling - nearly no
interactive functionality, no input/output capabilities and no modification tools are provided. These are handled by
dedicated modules (e.g. the `parser` module for reading queries from text, or the `transform` module for changing existing
query objects).

In addition to the pure `SqlQuery`, a number of subclasses exist. These model queries with specific ``FROM`` clauses. For
example, the `ImplicitSqlQuery` provides an `ImplicitFromClause` that restricts how tables can be referenced in this clause.
For some use-cases, these might be easier to work with than the more general `SqlQuery` class, where much more diverse ``FROM``
clauses are permitted.

In line with the other parts of the query abstraction layer, queries are designed as read-only data objects. Any forced
modifications on queries will break the entire qal and result in unpredictable behaviour.

class SqlQuery:
    """Represents an arbitrary SQL query, providing direct access to the different clauses in the query.

    At a basic level, PostBOUND differentiates between two types of queries:

    - implicit SQL queries specify all referenced tables in the ``FROM`` clause and the join predicates in the ``WHERE``
      clause, e.g. ``SELECT * FROM R, S WHERE R.a = S.b AND R.c = 42``. This is the traditional way of writing SQL queries.
    - explicit SQL queries use the ``JOIN ON`` syntax to reference tables, e.g.
      ``SELECT * FROM R JOIN S ON R.a = S.b WHERE R.c = 42``. This is the more "modern" way of writing SQL queries.

    There is also a third possibility of mixing the implicit and explicit syntax. For each of these cases, designated
    subqueries exist. They all provide the same functionality and only differ in the (sub-)types of their ``FROM`` clauses.
    Therefore, these classes can be considered as "marker" types to indicate that at a certain point of a computation, a
    specific kind of query is required. The `SqlQuery` class acts as a superclass that specifies the general behaviour of all
    query instances and can act as the most general type of query.

    The clauses of each query can be accessed via properties. If a clause is optional, the absence of the clause is indicated
    through a ``None`` value. All additional behaviour of the queries is provided by the different methods. These are mostly
    focused on an easy introspection of the query's structure.

    Notice that PostBOUND does not enforce any semantics on the queries (e.g. regarding data types, access to values, the
    cardinality of subquery results, or the connection between different clauses). This has to be done by the user, or by the
    actual database system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    select_clause : clauses.Select
        The ``SELECT`` part of the query. This is the only required part of a query. Notice however, that some database systems
        do not allow queries without a ``FROM`` clause.
    from_clause : Optional[clauses.From], optional
        The ``FROM`` part of the query, by default ``None``
    where_clause : Optional[clauses.Where], optional
        The ``WHERE`` part of the query, by default ``None``
    groupby_clause : Optional[clauses.GroupBy], optional
        The ``GROUP BY`` part of the query, by default ``None``
    having_clause : Optional[clauses.Having], optional
        The ``HAVING`` part of the query, by default ``None``.
    orderby_clause : Optional[clauses.OrderBy], optional
        The ``ORDER BY`` part of the query, by default ``None``
    limit_clause : Optional[clauses.Limit], optional
        The ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` part of the query. In standard SQL, this is designated using the ``FETCH FIRST`` syntax.
        Defaults to ``None``.
    cte_clause : Optional[clauses.CommonTableExpression], optional
        The ``WITH`` part of the query, by default ``None``
    hints : Optional[clauses.Hint], optional
        The hint block of the query. Hints are not part of standard SQL and follow a completely system-specific syntax. Even
        their placement in within the query varies from system to system and from extension to extension. Defaults to ``None``.
    explain : Optional[clauses.Explain], optional
        The ``EXPLAIN`` part of the query. Like hints, this is not part of standard SQL. However, most systems provide
        ``EXPLAIN`` functionality. The specific features and syntax are quite similar, but still system specific. Defaults to
        ``None``.
