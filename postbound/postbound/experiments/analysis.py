    """Modifies a benchmark result dataframe such that it can be written to CSV files without problems.

    This mostly involves converting Python objects to JSON counterparts that allow a reconstruction of equivalent data.

    More specifically, the function handles two main aspects:

    1. making sure that the query result can be written to CSV, and
    2. making sure that the description of the optimization pipeline can be written to CSV.

    In both cases, the column values will be transformed to JSON-objects if necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results_df : pd.DataFrame
        The result dataframe created by one of the benchmark functions

    By default, the entries in the result data frame will be sorted either sequentially, or by a lexicographic ordering on the

    In contrast to lexicographic sorting, natural sorting handles numeric labels in a better way: labels like
    1a, 10a and 100a are sorted in this order instead of in reverse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results_df : pd.DataFrame
        Data frame containing the results to sort
    by_column : str | tuple[str], optional
        The columns by which to order, by default (runner.COL_LABEL, runner.COL_EXEC_IDX). A lexicographic ordering will
        be applied to all of them.

    Returns
    -------

        A reordered data frame. The original data frame is not modified

    This upper bound is a very coarse one, based on three assumptions:

    1. any join sequence (even involving cross-products) of any form (i.e. right-deep, bushy, ...) is allowed
    2. the choice of scan operators and join operators can be varied freely
    3. each table can be scanned using arbitrary operators

    The number of real-world query execution plans will typically be much smaller, because cross-products are only
    used if really necessary and the selected join operator influences the scan operators and vice-versa.

    ----------
